### Testing and Piloting

After successfully recruiting implementation partners, develop a project plan to outline the requirements for a successful pilot project. Section 5 of the Public Health FHIR Playbook details seven steps for implementing FHIR use cases, which can guide the project plan's development and testing of necessary tools and workflows. In addition to building technical capabilities for RESTful API queries, consider the following topics:
-  Updating of existing end user workflows
-  Data governance
-  Test plan creation and execution
-  Staff training requirements
-  Change management processes

The Helios Public Health FHIR Query & Response priority area conducts regular testing sessions at Connectathons which demonstrate the latest capabilities of QHINs, interface engines, case management systems, and other FHIR clients.
