### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to assist public health agency programs in accessing healthcare data through FHIR-based query and response methods. It outlines the application of the HL7 FHIR RESTful API in public health agency data sharing use cases, improving access to vital public health data needed for functions such as case investigation and service provision. By leveraging existing FHIR API support, authorized public health agency programs can proactively access data held by healthcare providers and other sources. This approach enables efficient data retrieval through a standardized method, minimizing the time and effort required from data sources in fulfilling requests. Readers are encouraged to consult the base HL7 FHIR RESTful API documentation for a comprehensive overview of FHIR as a RESTful specification. FHIR-based querying is set to become a key component of efficient and scalable improvement to public health data and workflow support.

### Introduction

FHIR Query and Response is a data exchange paradigm that streamlines the sharing of public health data. The [HL7 Helios FHIR Accelerator for Public Health](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=216238674) aims to support public health partners by helping them leverage use cases (see appendix A) through existing FHIR API functionality provided by EHRs and other health IT systems. Helios collaborates with implementers to test and pilot FHIR APIs, enabling access to patient data that was previously difficult to obtain without significant manual effort. 

### Benefits to Public Health

FHIR query-based data exchange offers public health agencies a transformative opportunity to streamline access to health information and reduce inefficiencies in manual data retrieval. Traditionally, obtaining patient data for case investigations, treatment verification, and surveillance involved time-consuming processes like EHR abstraction, faxing, and phone calls. Standardized FHIR queries enable automated, real-time access to relevant health data directly from EHR systems and other health IT sources. 

By leveraging existing FHIR API capabilities, public health agency programs can:

-  **Enhance Efficiency**: Replace manual data requests with automated queries, reducing administrative burden.
-  **Improve Timeliness**: Expedite case investigation and public health agency response by retrieving authorized data in near real-time.
-  **Ensure Accuracy & Completeness**: Minimize data entry errors or missing information through structured, standardized queries.
-  **Support Minimum Necessary Data Principles**: Facilitate targeted data retrieval, ensuring access to only relevant and authorized information.
-  **Strengthen Public Health Outcomes**: Improve disease surveillance, follow-up care, and outbreak response through seamless, timely data access.

With the growing emphasis on health data interoperability and regulatory support for standardized exchange mechanisms, FHIR-based querying is poised to become a cornerstone of efficient and scalable public health data access. Investing in this approach fosters collaboration across healthcare entities, optimizes resource allocation, and enhances public health agencies' ability to safeguard community health.
